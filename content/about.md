# 🐧 tfr — Cybersecurity Penguin

Hey! I’m **Cameron**, but I go by **tfr** online.  
I break things, fix things, reverse things, and occasionally ask penguins about if I'm ready for the OSCP+. [^1]

This blog is mostly just for me to write about my current focuses, projects, machines I'm working or anything really. I've been gifted with a brain of many interests but cursed to a life with little time so I tend to work on a few things at once.
My hope is that this blog will help me stay committed and finish things I start, rather than just learning what I need and leaving it behind.

[^1]: *Is anyone ever really ready?*

## 🧭 What I Do

I live somewhere between **low-level systems work** and **web application testing**, poking at anything that looks fun, dangerous, or confusing (preferably all three).

Some of my usual focuses:

- 🔍 **Low-level engineering**
- 🕸️ **Web application testing**
- 🧬 **Reverse engineering**
- 🐍 **Python**, 🦀 **Rust**, 🧵 **Assembly**
- 🤖 Weird little **AI experiments**

I’ve wrapped up a **cybersecurity degree**, and now I spend my time grinding through machines, dabbling in bug bounties, and key word: *attempting* certs.

## 🛠️ Projects & Tinkering

A few creations I’ve unleashed into the world:

- 🧩 **DLL injector in Rust**  
- 🔢 **Digit recognition model** in Python  
- 🧪 **Particle simulations** in Rust without a graphics library (because *why not*... I had a graphical rendering phase and wanted to learn a but about window's API) 

Most of my work is basically me following the "that looks fun" until it isn't workflow.

## 🧰 Skills & Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Rust, Assembly, basic C  
- **Currently learning:** JavaScript + web stacks  
- **Domains:** RE, web pentesting, system internals, CTF’ing, AI experimentation

## 🐧 Fun Stuff (aka The Non-Technical Bits)

Outside the terminal, you’ll usually find me:

- Bouldering until my hands question their life choices  
- Swimming laps for that “brain reboot”

## 🎯 Vibe

Clear, technical writing with just enough personality to prove I’m not secretly apart of the dead internet theory… probably.
